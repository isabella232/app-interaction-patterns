## Description

Your Slack app lives in a virtual place called an App Home. Users find it by locating or adding your app in their channel sidebar, under the Apps heading.

Your App Home is essentially a private, 1:1 conversation between a person and your bot user. It works just like a direct message between two users, using the same events and Web API methods.

By enabling the `app_home_opened` event you are able to greet users with interactive, educational experiences and unlock the full potential of your App Home.

More information around App Home can be found on our [API docs](https://api.slack.com/reference/app-home).

_Please note that this event only works in your app's DM._

### Examples

* Onboarding new users once they open your App's DM for the first time
* Send a help message with important Call-to-actions once they open your App's DM

## Required features

* [Bot User](https://api.slack.com/bot-users)
* [Events API](https://api.slack.com/events-api)

## Required scopes

* [`bot`](https://api.slack.com/scopes/bot)

## Required event subscriptions

* [`app_home_opened`](https://api.slack.com/events/app_home_opened)

## Implementation overview

### 1. Receive `app_home_opened` event

This app event notifies your app when a user has entered the App Home.

Your Slack app must have a bot user configured and installed to use this event.

If the user opens a tab within the App Home, the event payload for this event will reference that in the tab field. If they opened a Home tab, a view field will also be included, containing the current state of that Home tab, including the list of blocks, and various pieces of metadata.

#### Event

* [`app_home_opened`](https://api.slack.com/events/app_home_opened)

#### Event payload

```
POST /your-event-subscription-url HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Slackbot 1.0 (+https://api.slack.com/robots)
Content-Type: application/json
X-Slack-Signature: v0=xxxxxx
X-Slack-Request-Timestamp: 1575670714

{
  "team_id": "TXXXXX",
  "api_app_id": "AXXXXXX",
  "event": {
    "type": "app_home_opened",

    "type": "event_callback",
    "event_id": "EXXXXXX",
    "event_time": 1575670714
  }
}
```

### 2. Send a welcome message if users has opened your App's DM for the first time

To determine if a user opens your message tab for the first time, you can either
1. track the `app_home_opened` event on your side.
2. use the [`im.history`](https://api.slack.com/methods/im.history) and query the history for existing messages. If the history is empty, you can assume a user has opened the messages tab for the first time.
